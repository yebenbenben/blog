      <description>I just got back from a five days trip to Red River Gorge in Kentucky. Prior to this trip, I have been a gym rat for almost 2 years and never got a chance to explore the great climbing areas in the states besides Gunks. Two years ago, when I just started bouldering at BKB, one friend of mine took me out for outdoor climbing at Gunks. That trip opened the door for outdoor climbing, before that I never see myself climbing a real rock.</description>
